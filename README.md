## 🌟 Project Overview

The **Spotify Music Analysis** project is a deep dive into the **musical universe of Spotify**, exploring how factors like **energy**, **danceability**, and **popularity** define today's hits.

This project focuses on discovering hidden insights behind songs, artists, and genres using **data visualization, feature analysis**, and **statistical storytelling**—transforming raw data into visual symphonies.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

The analysis was structured around the following goals:

* ✔️ Perform **data cleaning and wrangling** on the Spotify dataset.
* ✔️ Discover trends in **song popularity, loudness, and energy**.
* ✔️ Visualize patterns using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**.
* ✔️ Identify **top artists, genres, and track features**.
* ✔️ Generate **WordClouds** and interactive visual dashboards.

## 🧩 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of thousands of Spotify tracks with detailed attributes about audio features and metadata.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `track_name` | Name of the song |
| `artist_name` | Name of the artist |
| `genre` | Genre of the song |
| **`popularity`** | Popularity score (0–100) |
| `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `valence` | Audio feature values |
| `tempo` | Beats per minute (BPM) |
| `duration_ms` | Song length in milliseconds |
| `release_date` | Song release date |

> 🎶 The dataset captures the essence of modern music across diverse genres and timelines.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

A robust pipeline was implemented to ensure data quality:

1.  Loaded the dataset using **Pandas**.
2.  Checked for **missing values** and **duplicates** (and handled as necessary).
3.  Standardized column names and converted data formats.
4.  Removed outliers using the **Z-score method (SciPy)**.
5.  Verified data integrity with shape and info checks.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA utilized dynamic visualizations to uncover underlying musical trends.

### Visual Insights

* Top 10 Most Streamed Artists
* Popular Genres by Average Popularity score
* Relationship between Loudness & Energy
* Danceability Trends across Genres
* Valence (Mood) vs. Tempo Comparison
* Correlation Heatmap for Audio Features
* WordCloud for Genre Frequency

> ✨ **Tools Used:** **Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly Express** were employed for dynamic and interactive visualizations.
